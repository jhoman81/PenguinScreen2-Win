# VR profiles

One file per game, named by the disc serial (`SLUS-20851.yaml`). A profile
holds the VR tuning for that game: where the virtual screen sits and how much
stereo depth the picture gets. The profiles are licensed separately from the
emulator; see `LICENSE.md` in this folder.

## Changing a profile

Do not edit the files here. They are replaced on every update and are
read-only in a flatpak install.

1. Copy the game's file into your **user profiles folder**. The emulator
   creates that folder on first use and leaves a short note in it, along with
   a ready-to-edit copy of one shipped profile, `SLUS-20851.yaml` (Ace Combat
   5). Because that copy is in your folder, it is the one in effect for that
   game.
2. Edit the copy. A user file overrides the shipped file for the same serial,
   whole file for whole file.
3. A log line containing `user profile overrides shipped` confirms your copy
   is in effect. It appears whenever the profiles are loaded: when the
   emulator starts, and again after you change a profile file.

To go back to the shipped profile, delete your copy. If you delete the seeded
`SLUS-20851.yaml`, the emulator recreates it as a fresh copy of the shipped one,
which gives the same result. While any copy of a game's profile is in your
folder — including the untouched seed — updates to that game's shipped profile
do not reach you until you delete it.

Every profile is checked at launch. An invalid file is reported in a dialog
that names the file and the reason, and that one game falls back; other games
are unaffected. Keys the emulator does not know are ignored, so a newer profile
still loads on an older build.

## File layout

```yaml
SLUS-20851:              # the disc serial; must match the file name
  name: "Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War"   # display name
  crcs: [0x39B574F0]     # optional: only apply to these disc CRCs (hex)
  tier: stereo           # screen | stereo | immersive
  screen: { ... }        # where the virtual screen sits
  stereo: { ... }        # depth tuning
```

`tier` states what the profile is meant to provide: `screen` is a flat virtual
screen, `stereo` adds per-eye depth, `immersive` adds a head-driven camera. It
is a label: it does not switch anything on or off. A value outside those three
rejects the profile.

## `screen`: the virtual screen

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `distance` | metres in front of you |
| `height` | height of a flat screen, in metres; its width follows from the aspect ratio setting (a curved screen's size comes from `distance` and `arc` instead) |
| `follow` | `head` keeps the screen in front of you as you turn; `world` leaves it fixed in the room |
| `arc` | curve of the screen in degrees; below `5` the screen is flat. Needs a VR runtime with cylinder-layer support, otherwise the screen is shown flat |
| `lagMs` | with `follow: head` and a head camera: how many milliseconds the game's picture trails your head (0 to 250; off when left out). The screen is held where your head was that long ago, once per game frame, on the axes the `camera` block drives, so the scene stays put in the room instead of sliding with every head turn. Raise it if the scene still drags with your head, lower it if it swings back |

A `distance`, `height` or `arc` written here wins over the matching slider in
the settings window for that game. Leave a key out to keep it adjustable from
the settings window.

## `stereo`: depth

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `separation` | how far apart the two eyes' images are pushed. Larger is deeper. Start small: in the shipped profiles the values directly under `stereo:` (outside `scenes`) run from `0.007` to `0.02` |
| `convergence` | the depth that sits exactly at the screen surface. Content nearer than this stays at the screen; content beyond it goes into the screen. The useful range depends entirely on the game: in the shipped profiles the values directly under `stereo:` run from `0.005` to `6.0`, so adjust from the shipped value and do not copy one game's number to another |

Depth goes *into* the screen, never out toward you, as long as `separation`
is positive. The emulator does not check its sign, and a negative value turns
the depth inside out. A negative `hudCollimate` `disparity` (below) likewise
places aiming marks in front of the screen; it is accepted with a warning. Keep
both positive.

If far scenery looks doubled or is uncomfortable to look at, lower
`separation`. If the whole picture looks flat, raise it, or lower
`convergence`. This applies to the plain pair; when a depth map is in use,
adjust the map's own values instead (see below).

### Different depth for different parts of a game

One `separation` / `convergence` pair rarely suits both gameplay and menus, or
both a cockpit and the world outside it. Two tools cover that.

**`scenes`** switches the pair when the game changes state. The shipped
profiles use this for menus and alternate camera views. Each rule has a `when`
block that identifies the game state; leave those as shipped. The values you
can adjust are each rule's own `separation` and `convergence`. A rule that
leaves one out inherits the base value. The first matching rule wins.

**`map: bands`** gives each depth range its own setting, so near objects and
the distant world can both have comfortable depth at once:

```yaml
stereo:
  map: bands
  splits: [...]          # where one band ends and the next begins, near to far
  bands:                 # exactly one more entry than splits; first is nearest
    - { conv: 2.0, sep: 0.008 }
    - { conv: 2.0, sep: 0.006 }
    - { conv: 8.0, sep: 0.009 }
```

At most 3 splits and 4 bands. `sep` must be greater than 0 and `conv` must not
be negative. The joins between bands are worked out for you so depth stays
continuous. An invalid band set is reported in the log and ignored: in the
block directly under `stereo:` the game falls back to the plain `separation` /
`convergence` pair, and in a scene it falls back to whatever the block under
`stereo:` uses. A band set that exceeds the
comfort budget is loaded with a warning.

`map: log` is a smooth alternative with no band edges:

```yaml
stereo:
  map: log
  log: { w0: 2000, w1: 22000, dfar: 0.02 }   # near anchor, far anchor, depth reached at the far anchor
```

`w1` must be greater than `w0`, `w0` greater than 0, and `dfar` must not be
negative.

While `map` is `bands` or `log`, the plain `separation` / `convergence` pair is
not used, in the base block or in a scene: adjust the band or `log` values
instead. The plain pair takes over only if the map is invalid.

### HUD aiming marks: `hudCollimate`

Flat HUD elements stay at the screen surface, which is right for text. Aiming
marks such as a target bracket are easier to use when they sit at the depth of
the thing they surround. `hudCollimate` moves matched HUD draws to a fixed
depth.

`disparity` is that depth. Values above `0.0135` load with a comfort warning,
and values above `0.01815` make the emulator ignore the `hudCollimate` block;
the rest of the profile still loads. The `rules` list selects which HUD
draws are affected and is specific to each game; leave it as shipped. This
feature works on the Vulkan renderer only.

## Everything else

Shipped profiles also contain `camera`, `writes`, `guards`, `base` and similar
blocks. These tie the profile to one specific game build and are not
documented here. Changing them can crash the game or corrupt a session. Leave
them exactly as shipped.
